if we want to use keyboard event we need to use at first listen function then we need to use a onkey func that will be like screen.onkey(func,key)
there func would be like
    def up(self):                                       up=90
        if self.head.heading() = 90                     down=270
            self.head.setheading(self.UP)               left=180
                                                        right=0
